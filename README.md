# Web-Visualization-Dashboard
A Visualization Dashboard Website

For this project I visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past project. Specifically, I'll be plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
